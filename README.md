# Simple attiny-based weather station

This project is my warmup for bigger things using ESP01.
It is requesting openweather.com for data about current weather and display them on LCD.

REMEMBER: You need to run some pre-setup of ESP01 module, before it could be used with this application. You need to store inside EEPROM your ESSID configuration data, and allow module to connect your WiFi at startup.
